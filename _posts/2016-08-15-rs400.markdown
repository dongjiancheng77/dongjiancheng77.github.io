An intelligent Pinyin input method first employs the HMM and Viterbi algorithm to accomplish Pinyin input. Then, it employs rule-based methods to achieve improved Pinyin segmentation for instances involving incorrect order, ambiguity, abbreviations, and similar situations. Finally, a LSTM model is utilized to train on a small dataset, enabling automatic prediction of the next word.

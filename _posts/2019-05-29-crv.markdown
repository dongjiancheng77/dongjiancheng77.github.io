1. Revisiting several classic methods of image captioning (Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator, CVPR 2015, Meshed-Memory Transformer for Image Captioning, CVPR 2020)
2. Investigating image description evaluation metrics（CLIPScore: A Reference-free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning, EMNLP 2021， UMIC: An Unreferenced Metric for Image Captioning via Contrastive Learning, ACL 2021）
3. Exploring the application of cross-modal pretraining in image captioning（Unified Vision-Language Pre-Training for Image Captioning and VQA, AAAI 2020, Oscar: Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training for Vision-Language Tasks, ECCV 2020)
4. Fine-tuning CLIP using existing image-text paired human-scored datasets.([Thumb](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.254/))

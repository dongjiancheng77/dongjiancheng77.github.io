I collaborated with two senior colleagues on a project where we utilized the CVAE structure on the LLaMA model. We used latent variables to allow different answers to the same question to correspond to different inputs and latent variables, thereby alleviating conflicts. At the same time, we hoped that these latent variables could model the differences between various answers.

Dear Prof. Qin,

My name is Jiancheng Dong, a senior undergraduate student at Nanjing University. I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your research group at HKUST (Guangzhou) as a PhD student starting in Fall 2025. Having closely followed your work on advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and enabling their efficient adaptation to new tasks while preserving knowledge, I believe my research aligns well with your vision.

I recently authored a paper titled **"Threshold Filtering Packing for Supervised Fine-Tuning: Training Related Samples within Packs"** (accepted to the NAACL 2025 main conference). This work shares methodological similarities with your **Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS)** framework for in-context learning—both utilize Sentence-BERT to identify relevant samples. However, while IDS focuses on selecting demonstrations aligned with reasoning paths, my approach prioritizes constructing optimized training "packs" to enhance fine-tuning abilit and efficiency. This idea originated from my hands-on experimentation with Hugging Face’s codebase, which I independently developed and refined to completion.

Your emphasis on enabling LLMs to adapt effectively to new tasks while retaining prior knowledge, alongside advancing their reasoning capabilities, strongly resonates with my research trajectory. Recently, I have been exploring emerging reasoning paradigms such as **Coconut** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769)), which leverages the last hidden state of LLMs to represent their reasoning state—a mechanism reminiscent of RNN-like architectures. This raises intriguing questions about mitigating forgetting and overfitting in iterative reasoning frameworks, a topic I believe holds significant potential for future exploration.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I sincerely appreciate your attention and would be honored to discuss how my background in fine-tuning optimization and reasoning frameworks could contribute to your group’s research.

**Best regards,**

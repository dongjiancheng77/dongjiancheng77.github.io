Hand tracking with a time-of-flight camera. Work with Stan Melax, Sterling Orsten, others.

Working with Stan Melax & Sterling Orsten at Projects, I worked on the development of a unique, novel 3D hand tracking solution that worked in real-time on consumer hardware. It was shown at CES 2013 briefly during the Projects Keynote and [was seen on the show floor (starting at 0:55)](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851656/Projects-perceptual-computing-hands-on-video){:target="_blank"}. Additional samples of it working are available on Stan Melax's YouTube page and embedded below.

# 1. Revisiting several classic methods of image captioning (Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator, CVPR 2015, Meshed-Memory Transformer for Image Captioning, CVPR 2020)
# 2. Investigating image description evaluation metrics（CLIPScore: A Reference-free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning, EMNLP 2021， UMIC: An Unreferenced Metric for Image Captioning via Contrastive Learning, ACL 2021）
# 3. Exploring the application of cross-modal pretraining in image captioning（Unified Vision-Language Pre-Training for Image Captioning and VQA, AAAI 2020, Oscar: Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training for Vision-Language Tasks, ECCV 2020)
# 4. Fine-tuning CLIP using existing image-text paired human-scored datasets.([Thumb](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.254/))

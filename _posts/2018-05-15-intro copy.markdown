MoDS is a Model-oriented Data Selection for Instruction Tuning. The core idea is to filter the original dataset from three aspects: data quality, coverage range, and necessity, ultimately obtaining high-quality datasets for different models. Compared to automatic identification methods, better results can be achieved with less data.
